1.	How Version Control Helps Track Changes Version Control Systems (VCS) serve as the backbone of modern software development by acting as a detailed historical record of a project. At its core, version control tracks every modification made to the code—whether it is adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or changing documentation—in discrete units called "commits." Unlike simply saving a file, which overwrites the previous version, a VCS saves a snapshot of the entire project at that moment in time. This allows developers to travel back to any previous state of the project. If a new update breaks the software, the team can "revert" to a working version instantly. Furthermore, the history log provides context; it answers not just what changed, but who changed it and why (via commit messages), creating an audit trail that is essential for long-term project maintenance.

2.	Collaboration Benefits of Version Control Version control transforms coding from a solitary activity into a collaborative one. Here are three specific benefits:
•	Concurrent Development (Avoiding Overwrites): Without VCS, if two developers edit the same file, the last person to save overwrites the other's work. With Git, multiple developers can work on the same file simultaneously. The system intelligently merges these changes. If there is a conflict (e.g., editing the same line), Git pauses and asks the human to decide which code to keep, ensuring no work is accidentally lost.
•	Feature Isolation (Branching): Developers can create "branches"—parallel versions of the main project—to work on new features or     experiments. For example, a developer can create a branch to test a new login system. If the experiment fails, the branch can be deleted without ever affecting the stable "main" code that users are seeing. If it succeeds, it is merged back in.
•	Accountability and Traceability: The git blame command allows a team to see exactly who wrote a specific line of code. This is not just for finding fault; it is crucial for context. If a line of code looks confusing, a developer can check the history to see who wrote it and ask them directly for clarification, streamlining communication.

3.	Backup and Recovery Mechanisms Git is a "Distributed Version Control System" (DVCS), which provides superior backup capabilities compared to centralized systems. In a centralized system, the history lives on one server; if that server fails, the history is lost. In Git, every developer who clones the repository downloads a full, mirror copy of the entire project history onto their local machine. This means every developer’s computer acts as a full backup. If the main server (like GitHub) crashes or is corrupted, the repository can be fully restored—including all branches and history—from any team member’s local copy. This redundancy makes data loss extremely unlikely.

4.	The Difference Between Git and GitHub While often used interchangeably, Git and GitHub are distinct tools. Git is the actual version control software installed on your local computer. It is a command-line tool that tracks changes, creates commits, and manages branches locally; it does not require internet access to function. GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-hosting service built on top of Git. It acts as a remote hub where developers push their local Git repositories to share with others. GitHub adds a layer of social and project management features that Git does not have, such as Pull Requests, Issue Tracking, and code reviews, facilitating collaboration across the internet.
